Project Title: Open-Source AI Platform for CT-to-Text Captioning and Expert Labeling of CT Data

PROJECT SUMMARY

Overview:
We propose to develop an open-source AI platform that will catalyze a new era of automated morphological analysis by building upon the rich CT datasets from oVert and MorphoSource. This platform will enable the rapid development of specialized AI agents for analyzing biological form, from automated landmarking to evolutionary trait analysis. By combining MONAI [1] with modern foundation models [2] and the extensive vertebrate CT collection from oVert [3], we will create a framework where researchers can easily train and deploy custom AI models for their specific morphological research questions.

Intellectual Merit:
This project will transform how morphological research is conducted by enabling rapid development of specialized AI agents for biological form analysis. Key innovations include:
- A foundation model pre-trained on oVert's comprehensive vertebrate CT collection [3,4]
- An extensible framework for training specialized morphology analysis agents [5]
- Novel techniques for few-shot learning of new morphological features [6]
- Integration with existing tools like ALPACA for automated landmarking [7]
- Standardized interfaces for community contribution of new analysis methods [8]

Broader Impacts:
- Democratizes access to advanced morphological analysis tools
- Accelerates evolutionary and developmental biology research
- Enables new types of large-scale comparative studies
- Creates a community platform for sharing specialized analysis agents
- Advances open science through integration with MorphoSource
- Provides educational tools for teaching morphological concepts

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

The oVert Revolution in Morphological Data:
The NSF-funded oVert (OpenVertebrate) project has created an unprecedented resource: high-resolution CT scans of over 30,000 fluid-preserved vertebrate specimens [3]. This dataset, hosted on MorphoSource, represents every living vertebrate genus. While this data collection is transformative, its full potential remains untapped due to the manual effort required for morphological analysis [9].

Need for AI-Powered Analysis:
Traditional morphological studies are limited by the time-intensive nature of manual analysis. Even with tools like ALPACA for automated landmarking [7], researchers still face bottlenecks in:
- Identifying and measuring specific anatomical features
- Comparing morphological variations across species
- Detecting subtle evolutionary patterns
- Analyzing developmental sequences
- Quantifying shape changes

OBJECTIVES

1. Foundation Model Development
Create a morphology-focused foundation model pre-trained on the complete oVert CT collection, providing a base understanding of vertebrate anatomy [15].

2. Agent Development Framework
Build an extensible platform where researchers can easily create specialized AI agents for their specific morphological analysis needs [16].

3. Integration with Existing Tools
Seamlessly connect with MorphoSource, ALPACA, and other community tools to create a comprehensive morphology research ecosystem [17].

4. Community Platform
Develop infrastructure for sharing and improving morphological analysis agents across the research community [18].
